When you've declared your array adapter of strings, it should look something

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,500
like this. We pass in a context, which is this fragment's parent activity,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,010
as well as the ID of the list item layout, and the ID of the text view we

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,380
want to populate. And lastly, we pass in the forecast data.

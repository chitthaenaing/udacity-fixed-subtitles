1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,160
Once you install Android Studio, you can open it and

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,240
check for updates before proceeding. Then we can configure Android Studio.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,470
Open up the Android SDK Manager to see what tools, platform versions, and

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,330
components we have installed. At the time of this recording,

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,900
the Android L platform is available but it's still in developer preview mode.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,770
That means it's subject to change until the official release. You can't upload

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,928
your app to Google Play if it's targeting this L platform version.

8
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:31,670
Hence, we want to use the latest stable platform version which is KITKAT or

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,830
API level 19. API level 20 is for Android ware or watches and not for

10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,836
phones or tablets. Deselect all the other packages. And just choose the ones for

11
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:45,470
API level 19. We want the SDK as well as the system images for the emulator.

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,690
We also want the Android Support Library for backwards compatibility. For

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,640
the most up-to-date version of all the packages you need to install,

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,160
check the link below. Otherwise, continue with installing the packages.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,370
Accept the license and then install. Then we can click and

16
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,860
create a new project. In the Project Wizard, we set the app name to be Sunshine.

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,200
Then we provide a corresponding package name. For distribution purposes,

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,190
the package name should be globally unique across packages installed on Android.

19
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,190
To avoid conflicts, you can use the reverse of the internet domain that you own.

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,240
This follows the Java package naming conventions. Note that we're also using

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,150
the com dot example namespace for our Sunshine app since it's a sample, but

22
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,010
you cannot publish an app on Google play that uses this namespace.

23
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,020
Usually leaving the default package name that's suggested is fine. However,

24
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,410
this class was originally filmed with an older version of Android Studio which

25
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,280
added the app module at the end of the package name. So go ahead and

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,160
make this change now if you want your code to match the rest of the code in

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,580
the course. Then we do the project location and

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,030
we hit next. Now, we need to choose our minimum SDK version.

29
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,880
In previous versions of Android Studio, you would also have to

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,510
select the target SDK. But now the Project Wizard automatically sends the target

31
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,870
SDK to be the latest version. Even though target SDK is already selected for

32
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,800
you, it's important to know the distinction between min and target SDK

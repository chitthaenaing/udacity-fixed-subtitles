1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,780
In our code, we're going to initialize the adapter within the placeholder

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,530
fragment on create view method. Because that's where we want the list view to

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,790
be populated with data. We're using a array adapter, and we can initialize it

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,295
with four parameters. A context, the ID of a list item layout,

5
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:21,870
the ID of a text view within that list item layout, as well as a list of data.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,560
We'll go through each of these parameters one by one now. First, for

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,800
context. It contained global information about the App environment.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,520
It allows us to access system services and resources, as well as the application

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,600
specific resources that we've defined. We use the fragments containing activity

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,520
as the context. So, we're going to call getActivity for our parameter here.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,120
Since the adapter needs to know the layout for each list item, and

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,990
needs some reference to the XML layouts that we've defined. The r.java class is

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:58,210
a generated file that creates human readable identifiers for our resources. For

14
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,490
the list item layout, we refer to it in code as r.layout.list_item forecast.

15
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,546
This was the name of the XML file that we created earlier. Next,

16
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:11,630
the array adapter needs to know how to take the weather forecast string and

17
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,110
set that to be displayed in a text view. So you pass in the ID of the text view

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,820
that we defined earlier, in the list item layout. Even though these two resource

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,938
IDs look similar, one starts with R.layout while the other starts with R.id.

20
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:30,663
R.layout refers to a layout file, while an ID refers to a specific [UNKNOWN]

21
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:35,694
element with the matching ID attribute. And lastly, we pass in a week forecast,

22
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:40,400
which is the array list of forecast data that we defined earlier.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,030
Now go ahead and initialize your adapter. Check this box when you're done.

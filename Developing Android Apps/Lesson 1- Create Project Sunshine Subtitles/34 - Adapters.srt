Given some sample data how do we populate a ListView?

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,370
Let's look at an example of some contact data and how it can be displayed in

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,140
the list. We start with our raw data of contacts which is three contacts,

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,720
as well as our profile images. Then we pass this data into the adapter so

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,730
it has a reference to it. The adapter also knows how to build a list item layout

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,500
for each of these data items. So, it could go ahead and create the layouts for

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,160
them. But we don't need to create the views yet until the ListView requests that

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,290
it needs them. For example, if you had hundreds of contacts here,

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,740
you wouldn't want hundreds of layouts sitting around that aren't being used.

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,850
Then when you bind the adapter to the ListView,

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,710
the ListView will ask how many items are actually in the data set.

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,520
And the adapter will check in the data set there's three items, so

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,960
we will return that to the ListView. Now the ListView knows that it will have to

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,395
populate itself with three list items. Now the ListView starts at position

15
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:04,170
zero and asks for the list item layout located at that position. It goes back to

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,520
the adapter and the adapter checks that at position zero, we have the contact,

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,140
Anna. The adapter knows how to create a list item layout from the contact, Anna.

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,360
So, it goes ahead and does that. And then we return it to the ListView. And now

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,027
we see that the Anna list item is located at the zeroth position in the list.

20
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:29,270
Next the ListView wants to get the item at position one, so

21
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,340
ask for the layout from the adapter. The adapter checks that at position one,

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,110
we have the contact Bob. The adapter knows how to create a list item layout for

23
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,990
Bob so it goes ahead and does that and then it returns it to the ListView. And

24
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,660
now we see that the list item for Bob has been successfully added

25
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,010
to the ListView at position one. Now, the ListView fetches its

26
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,740
last item because it knows that there was three list items to expect.

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,280
It fetches the last list item layout at position two by asking the adapter.

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,890
The adapter checks that at position two, we have Charlie, as well as that image.

29
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,810
And we know how to make a list item layout for Charlie, so we can go ahead and

30
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,010
do that, and return it to the ListView. And now we have the list item for

31
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,180
Charlie and position two in the list. And we have our complete list

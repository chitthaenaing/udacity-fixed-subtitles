00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,969
I know you're excited to run the app. And I'm going to show you how to do it

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,970
without a physical device, because we'll be using the emulator. But

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,460
first, we need to install one more component from the Android SDK Manager.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,500
Click on this button to open up the Android SDK Manager. Scroll to the bottom of

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,030
the list to find HAXM. It stands for hardware accelerated execution manager. And

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,220
it will speed up our emulator. So go ahead and deselect the other packages, and

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,730
just install this one. Accept the license, and

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,990
then continue. We have to do one more step after this to install HAXM.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,840
I'll show you the remaining steps on a Mac, but for the other platforms you can

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,310
check the link below. First, find Android Studio under the applications folder,

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,010
and then hit show package contents. Then, in the SDK folder,

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,690
there'll be an extras folder containing an Intel folder with the HAXM folder.

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,160
Then, we click on the DMG file, open it up and

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,160
then continue. Step through this installer, and the default values are fine.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,620
Once installation is complete, you can close all the windows.

Thanks Rado, for telling us about the importance of proper dessert selection.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,950
Let's choose our dessert now. At the current time,

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,190
choosing Gingerbread covers 99% of the devices active on the Google Play store.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,920
It's also the cutout for using Google Play services, for things like maps and

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,830
location, and the Android support library. The support library package

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,230
offers an implementation of UI features that were added in later releases. But

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,230
now can be used on older versions of the platform, like Gingerbread.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,728
We pick the latest version of Gingerbread at API level 10, because it contains

9
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:36,540
bug fixes that API level 9 doesn't have. Then we go ahead and click Next. We're

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,020
presented with a list of templates that we can choose from in order to create

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,440
our new app. We're going to pick the Blank Activity with Fragment Template.

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,630
For background context, an activity serves as the presentation layer for our UI.

13
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,620
And the fragment within it represents a behavior or portion of the screen.

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,221
Go ahead and click Next. We call our activity main activity. And the layout

15
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:04,519
comes from the activity_main XML file. In similar fashion, the Fragments layout

16
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,060
comes from the fragment_main XML file. Then we go ahead and hit Finish.

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,680
You should have your newly created Sunshine app with the files on the left here.

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,170
Make sure you wait for the Gradel Build to finish. If you still see errors,

19
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,450
you can check the Guide and Instructor notes below on how to troubleshoot.

20
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,620
As a tip, you can check your Min and Target SDK versions in the build out Gradle

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,030
file located under the app Source folder. We want the compile SDK version and

22
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,130
the target SDK version to point to the latest table version of the platform.

23
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,040
In this case, it's 19 and not L. Once you have no errors,

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,960
we can add a custom app icon that'll be more fitting for

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,610
our weather app. Right-click on the app folder and go to New Image Asset.

26
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,640
Download the icon that we provide in the link below, then go ahead and

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,592
find that icon. And here you can see a preview of our temporary app icon.

28
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,240
We're going to get a better one in less than five. Then go ahead and

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,450
click Next and Finish. And the new icon shows up in the Drawable folders.

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,700
Go ahead and try it yourself. Make sure you're using the same settings as we

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,520
have by checking the link below. Click here when you're done.

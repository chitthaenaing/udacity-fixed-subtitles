Adding every item to the linear layout within the scroll view,

00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,300
meant that every view we create, sticks around, taking up memory, even if

00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,800
it's never been seen. We want to try and create a way, that we only need to use,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,990
as many views as are currently visible in the screen plus one on either end,

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,900
to make sure we can scroll without flickering. To do that,

00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,690
Android uses List View. So, let's take a closer look at that now.

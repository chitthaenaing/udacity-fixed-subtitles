With our ListView ready to go, we'll want to create some fake data to

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,778
populate it. Open up MainActivity.java and then scroll down to the bottom where

3
00:00:08,778 --> 00:00:13,630
the PlaceholderFragment class is. Within the onCreateView method,

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,630
create an array list of strings to represent the weather forecast list items

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,570
shown in the wire frames. For example, the Today List item will be

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,880
represented as a string shown here. When you're done, check the box and submit.

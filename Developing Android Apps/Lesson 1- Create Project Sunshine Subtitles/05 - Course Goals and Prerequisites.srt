1
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:30,939
We're expecting you to already be familiar with object-oriented programming, and

2
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:33,649
to have experience with Java or a similar language.

3
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:37,570
Personally, I got started with Android after years of Delphi and C# development.

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,560
As engineers, we're trained to map our experiences in one language or

5
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,470
SDK into new ones. Looking for patterns and shortcuts we can get up to

6
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,750
speed as quickly as possible. But mobile, and Android in particular,

7
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,220
have some fundamental differences that mean some of our experience and

8
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,910
intuition will actually make us worse mobile engineers. We like to think of

9
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,459
Smartphones as computers that fit into our pockets. In a way that's true, but

10
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,270
the computers from the 90s, like this Powerhouse I was using nearly 20

11
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,660
years ago. With limited internet connectivity, low speed CPUs, and limited RAM,

12
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,910
on top of which, they're all running on batteries. As we go through the course,

13
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,320
I'll be returning to each of these key mobile challenges. Looking for

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,160
places where you're experienced on desktop or

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,420
server, or even other mobile platforms might lead you in the wrong direction.

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,790
I will also be back to tell you some stories from the early days of Android.

17
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,190
Stories that describe how the Android platform has evolved. And nowhere is

18
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,830
that more readily apparent than here, at the Android Lawn sculpture garden.

19
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,620
Join me here, at the very heart of Android, at the end of this lesson,

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,030
to find out how this sculpture garden of tasty treats, also tell us the story of

21
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,840
Android's history. For now, let's get back to building that weather app.

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,790
So, we'll cross to Dan, to take a look at some mocks.

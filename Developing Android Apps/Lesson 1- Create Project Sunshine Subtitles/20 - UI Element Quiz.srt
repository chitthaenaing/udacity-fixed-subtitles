The editor is quite powerful. Without using any code, one can create relatively

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,150
sophisticated layouts. Make sure to use the built-in styled text widgets for

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,420
large and medium text. All of the text is just placeholder text, so

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,700
you easily enter it using the visual editor. If you're proud of your creation,

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,750
take a screenshot and post it along with the XML into the forums.

Now that you have some background on the basic tools in Android studio, and

00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,650
a few of the basic android user interface views,

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,170
Katherine will show you how to start making some sunshine.

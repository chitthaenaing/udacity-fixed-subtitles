1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,730
Now in Android studio you can hit the play button to run the app on your device.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,230
In the device Chooser dialog. you should see your connected device.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,280
To prevent the dialog from popping up in future times, check this box and

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,350
then hit OK to continue. Within a few moments you should see it on your phone.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,330
On the other hand, as Raido was mentioning, you can use command line tools.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,420
From the root folder of the project, use grade lw to build your app on Mac or

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,460
Linux. Check the link in the notes below if you're using Windows.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,410
This first command grants execution permission to the gradlw rappers script. And

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,240
you only need to do it the first time you're trying to build from the command

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,310
line. Then you can call grade lw assemble debug. Once the build is successful,

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,225
it creates an APK file at the app/build/apk directory. You can use

12
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:52,210
adb to install the app. The -r command means that you can replace an existing

13
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,270
version of the app if you've already done it before. For more tips on adb,

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,860
you can see the instructor notes below. Then you can use this adb command with

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,270
the activity manager tool in order to start the main activity. And there you see

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,450
it on the device. And now we see it running in our phones. Woo hoo! Fist bump!

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,050
We're on a roll. Let's go find Dan so that we can build up the sunshine UI. Woo!

1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,960
You should have changed the TextView into a ListView element.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,860
Then you can remove this text attribute because you don't need it anymore.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,900
Now from the UX mocks, you'll remember that the list takes up the whole screen,

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,160
so we want to set the width and height to be match_parent. That will make

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,460
the ListView match the dimensions of its parent, which is this RelativeLayout.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,895
And to find out the parent of this RelativeLayout, it's actually in this

7
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:29,530
activity_main XML file because the fragment is contained within the activity.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,860
Within this file, we see that this view is also match_parent for height and

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,380
width. So now we can confirm that the ListView actually will take up

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,116
the full screen. Going back to the fragment_main file, we can add the id,

11
00:00:42,116 --> 00:00:47,190
listview_forecast, onto the ListView. And then, since this layout only contains

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,255
one child, we can simplify the layout by changing this into a FrameLayout.

Perfect, thanks Dan. Since he's turned you into a UI expert now, where should we

2
00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:09,010
define this list item layout? If you're thinking the layout folder,

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,510
under the resources directory, then you are correct. Here you can create a new

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,375
layout resource file called list item forecast. Inside that file,

5
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:23,570
define a text view as the root view, then assign it an ID list item forecast

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,870
text view. Give it a minimum height, so that the list item isn't too short for

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,150
tapping on and vertically center the text within that item. Go ahead and

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,730
try it yourself now. And check the box when you're done.

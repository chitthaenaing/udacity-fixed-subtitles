1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,510
Now for the moment you've been waiting for. Let's run the app by clicking on

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,490
this button. It will prompt us to choose a device. Without a physical device we

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,210
can use the emulator which is included in the Android SDK.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,050
Currently it says that there are no Android virtual devices available. So,

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,060
let's open up the AVD manager to create one. Then click New. By creating an AVD,

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,980
we can configure an emulated device with the android platform version that we

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,150
want to test on, as well as hardware options. For our case,

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,850
we're going to emulate a Nexus 5 virtual device, the defaults are fine for now.

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,240
So, we're going to hit OK. Then we see that our AVD was created successfully.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,150
We can close the AVD Manager. And when we go back to the Device Chooser dialog,

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,050
we'll see that Nexus5 is an option. Then we can hit OK to launch the app.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,980
When it loads up, we see our Sunshine app with the words Hello world.

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,780
Keep in mind that the emulator is not just a simulator.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,510
It's actually running the Android Virtual Machine. So you can test and

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,300
debug your app on different hardware and software configurations.

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,520
You can interact with the app on the emulator using the screen or

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,060
with the navigation controls here. You can also invoke other apps,

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,850
do network calls, play audio or video and much more. It also includes debug

19
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,410
capabilities, including log output, and the ability to simulate app entraps or

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,560
network latency. You can also hit Home and browse around the device to see other

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,350
apps. For example, you can check out API demos. Feel free to

22
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,570
play around with the emulator some more. If you open up Android Device Monitor,

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,650
you can go into the Emulator Control Tab. There you'll see different options for

24
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,626
simulating behavior on your AVD, such as for telephony and for

25
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:43,910
location. Now that the Hello world app runs on the emulator,

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,710
let's see what goes on behind the scenes to make the app run.

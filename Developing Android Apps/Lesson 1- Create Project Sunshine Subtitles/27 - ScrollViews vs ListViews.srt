00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,260
On the surface, creating a list of items is simple enough.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,350
Android includes a Scroll View into which you can place any

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,740
linear layout that in turn arranges each item it contains into a vertical list.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,550
Note the items which have fallen off the bottom off the linear layout. And

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,630
therefore aren't currently visible in that UI. The Scroll View,

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,660
as the name suggests, will let the user scroll through the contents of

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,320
the layout it contains. But there's a challenge associated with that approach on

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,160
a device with limited memory, and where touch responsiveness is

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,900
critically important. If you have 50 items in a list and

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,250
can fit 10 items on screen at any given time. What's the minimum number of

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,150
views you'd need to create in order to scroll through every item on the list?

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,090
The answer might not be immediately obvious but think about ways in which you

13
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,270
can be more efficient in your use of the views used to display the entire list.

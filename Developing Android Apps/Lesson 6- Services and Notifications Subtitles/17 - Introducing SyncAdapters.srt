00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,410
There's a lot to learn with making background

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,610
transactions efficient. But the good news is that Android

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,070
gives you the Sync Manager framework that implements

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,190
many of these best practices. You utilize that framework

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,480
by implementing a sync adapter. The framework, originally

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,235
introduced in Android 2.0 Eclair or Android API level

7
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:21,880
5, allows Android applications to leverage the same

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,610
basic framework that Google apps use for efficient synchronization.

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,990
Ultimately, it's a centralized place to put all

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,060
of the device data transfers in one place.

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,310
So that they all be scheduled intelligently by

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,460
the OS. In other words, that's one big cookie.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,250
Android Sync Manager handles synchronization requests using sync

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,100
adapters. The Sync Manager batches and time shifts

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,480
these requests when possible to allow your data

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,770
transfers to be scheduled with transfers from other apps,

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,930
all working towards the goal of reducing the

18
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,040
number of times the system has to switch on

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,100
the radio. If your device has less memory,

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,890
it will schedule fewer simultaneous synchs. The Synch Manager

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,950
also takes care of things like checking for

22
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,980
network connectivity before initiating transfers and retrying downloads when

23
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,520
connectivity is dropped. The synchronization framework works with content

24
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,020
providers for two way synchronization and leverages the Android

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,500
account manager to provide synchronization services that are

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,290
tied to accounts. Our application will do neither

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,110
of these things, but we'll still have to

28
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,710
deal with some of the complexity of these features.

29
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,170
This can make SyncAdapter seem daunting at first.

30
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,680
What does the SyncManager do to help you fetch

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,480
data from the network? Does it schedule your

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,410
network jobs with other apps, implement a synchronization protocol,

33
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,550
store account information, or has logic to retry

34
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,650
your request? Select all of these that match.

00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,510
Typically when we talk about data transfer efficiency, we're talking

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,590
about limiting the amount of data being transferred. That reduces

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,990
the bandwidth and the cost and is generally a pretty

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,020
good idea. But on mobile there's an extra factor. As you

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,500
can see, it turns out that the cell radio is

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,430
one of the biggest battery drainers on the device. So making

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,840
your data transfers more efficient. Will also result in improved

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,430
battery life. Now, the basic level being more efficient means spending

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,320
less time transferring less data, reducing your payloads, and updating

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,560
less often can take you some of the way there,

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,650
but then what? Can timing make a difference? It turns

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,890
out that it can, and it's a situation I like

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,700
to think of as the cookie Droid conundrum. Do we

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,190
perform fewer downloads with larger payloads? Or do we perform

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,830
lots of small transfers just in time for when we

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,000
need them? One big cookie or lots of little cookies?

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,750
So, what do you think? Should we have

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,620
a smaller number of large downloads illustrated by

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,870
this big cookie? Or a large number of

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,880
small downloads, as illustrated by lots of little cookies.

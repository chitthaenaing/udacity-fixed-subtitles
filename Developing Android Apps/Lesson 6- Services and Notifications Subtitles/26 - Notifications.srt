1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,160
All right, you're done. There were a lot of new things that time. But, afterall,

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,530
you're becoming a seasoned Android programmer by now.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,910
As I mentioned before, we're going to use NotificationCompat.Builder

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,310
to build our notification. It's easy to build

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,000
a nice looking notification that has our icon

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,220
representing the weather forecast, the title for our

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,390
App. And our content text, the forecast with

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,600
highs and lows. We're going to use another class

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,130
from the support library, to create a task stack builder

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,960
for our pending intent. This is a simple case

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,880
of task stack builder, because all we have is a

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,980
single item on our stack. We just add the

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,700
next intent and use it to build out pending intent

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,470
that we pass into the notification manager. Finally we call

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,150
the notification manager with the built intent from our builder,

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,480
with a notify function. One of the great things about notification manager is

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,490
it can be used from any thread even though it is displaying UI.

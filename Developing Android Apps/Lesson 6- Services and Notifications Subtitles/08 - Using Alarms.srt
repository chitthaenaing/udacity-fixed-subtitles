1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,350
So, now, we have a simple service. Wasn't that easy?

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,140
But it still doesn't wake itself up. Fortunately, there's a system

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,430
service for that. This is a good opportunity to introduce

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,020
the AlarmManager. The AlarmManager allows you to tell the system that

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,220
you want it to wake a component of your application

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,690
up after a period of time and do some processing in

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,370
the background. You can even have it wake up your

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,780
application periodically but, what do we wake up in the background?

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,810
That would be an Android component we haven't

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,940
seen before called a Broadcast Receiver. A Broadcast Receiver

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,770
is a special class, that is used to

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,270
receive intent broadcast often from other applications. Typically a

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,020
broadcast receiver will register an intent filter for

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,690
these broadcasts. It's also one way the application will

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,980
listen in on alarms. So let's add some alarm

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,530
stuff. First, I'm going to add a Broadcast Receiver

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,100
as a static inner class of Sunshine Service.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,760
Since this is an Android component, I'll register

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,540
this Broadcast Receiver in the manifest. Note the

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,770
way a static inner class is notated. Okay, I've

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,080
given you the bones of a broadcast receiver

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,180
that can handle an alarm, but now it's

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,770
your turn. You can create a PendingIntent from

24
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,840
an explicit intent to have the alarm manager activate

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,390
your broadcast receiver. I recommend setting the alarm to something absurdly

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,030
short, like five seconds, so you can easily test that it's working.

1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,910
All right. And here's the solution. To start off, let's

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,010
look at our forecast fragment query. Since it's a join

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,830
between two tables, it's really easy for us to add

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,920
additional parameters to our query. Now we make sure we keep

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,390
the column indices consistent. Now we've grabbed the latitude and

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,270
longitude at the same time we're grabbing our weather entries.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,270
The next thing to do is to move the function

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,400
open preferred location in map over to forecast fragment. Instead of

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,170
using shared preferences to get these values, we can actually

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,870
get the cursor from the forecast adapter. We can get

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,480
our cursor moved to a reasonable position, and then build

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,160
our new string which is just latitude colon longitude. We'll

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,320
leave our comment where it was. Finally, we just have

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,900
to fix up a few things in the code and

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,630
that's it. Well, at least for the code. We still

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,600
need to do some work in XML. Let's move this R.ID.action

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,300
map now over to forecast fragment inside of it on

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,850
options item selected. And now we've got to do some

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,480
XML work. Let's look at our main menu. We'll just

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,620
pull this action map item out, and we'll place it right

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,160
into forecast fragment. All right. One more thing to do

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,960
while we're here. One of the things Raito talked about was

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,780
wanting to get rid of the refresh menu item. So,

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,000
let's just comment it out. When we remove that action refresh

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,710
item, we should probably comment it out from our source

26
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,710
code too. After all, you never know when you'll want to

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,800
use that for debugging. So, there we have it. Our

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,200
final app. No longer having a refresh button. With a

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,510
new exciting setting to turn off and on weather notifications.

30
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,520
Details are taken care of. I hope you've enjoyed building

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,390
Sunshine. There's still lots of things left to do in

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,250
Sunshine. For example, we could also add a lot more intelligent

33
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,710
things to its user interface. And of course, we

34
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,300
could make it a lot smarter about synching data.

35
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,730
And I hope the practices you've learned building Sunshine

36
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,573
will help you in all of your future applications

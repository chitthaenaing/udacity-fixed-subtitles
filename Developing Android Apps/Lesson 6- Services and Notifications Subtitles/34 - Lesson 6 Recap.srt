00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,780
Congratulations. You now know how to build an

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,290
app that runs beautifully in the foreground, and efficiently

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,840
in the background. In this lesson, you learned how

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,930
to use services and think adapters, as well as

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,020
creating rich notifications, all ways to provide a

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,670
great user experience, even when your app isn't visible.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,720
Join me now for the final story time, as

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,040
I take you into a possible future for Android.

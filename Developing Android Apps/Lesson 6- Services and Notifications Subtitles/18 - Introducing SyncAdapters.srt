The SyncManager does schedule your SyncAdapter

2
00:00:02,487 --> 00:00:04,720
jobs. But they don't have anything

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,600
to do with what goes over

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,400
the wire. There's no standard synchronization protocol.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,820
And while they're to tied to AccountManager, they've nothing to do with storing

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,280
account information. However, they will auto

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,010
retry requests, if network conditions are spotty.

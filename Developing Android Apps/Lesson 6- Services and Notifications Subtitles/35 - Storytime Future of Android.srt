1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,360
I was 12 years old when I got my first modem, a 1200 baud ACE compatible. I

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,335
started getting online, not the internet online, local

3
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:12,712
BBSs. At around the same time, yuppie was supporting

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,070
the first brick-sized mobile phones as the first

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,305
GSM network started rolling out. Fast forward less than

6
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:22,470
17 years to 2007, and the iPhone launches, followed

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,140
less than a year by Android. And almost overnight,

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,190
we've come to expect the world's information in the

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,740
palm of our hands. Just six years after the first

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,680
Android phone launched, it's powering everything from phones to

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,740
tablets, watches, TVs and cars. So where do we go

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,245
next? The most obvious answer is enabling the same

13
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:44,884
handheld cloud connecting computing platform to the next 5 billion

14
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:48,680
people. As hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful, more of

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,950
the world's population will be able to get internet-connected computers.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,100
And the smartphone is going to be what makes

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,850
it possible. To facilitate this, we're seeing new approaches

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,010
to getting online, mesh networks, white spaces, or even

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,610
Google's Project Loon. We'll hopefully soon see ubiquitous world-wide internet

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,160
connectivity become a reality. At the same time, smartphones

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,490
will start to disappear. In the same way that

22
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,810
we don't think of computers as computers once they

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,040
become part of our dishwashers, cars, or TVs, we'll stop

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,410
thinking of mobiles as such when they disappear into our

25
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,980
watches and [UNKNOWN]. We'll come to expect that anything that

26
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,800
can be improved through the incorporation of a wireless internet

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,820
connection will simply have one. For that to happen, we need

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,350
to find more creative ways to interact with computers than

29
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,570
using mouse, keyboards and touch screens. I can all ready pick

30
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,860
up my phone or lift my wrist, address Google, and

31
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,660
perform searches, send texts or email, set alarms, or take notes

32
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,470
without having to touch a screen or keyboard. Screen

33
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,970
themselves have become so sharp that pixel densities aren't

34
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,570
perceptible to the human eye. And the team at

35
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,630
Google X are building contact lenses capable of measuring blood

36
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,420
sugar levels. Speaking of senses, not only can I

37
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,590
control my phone by putting it either face up or

38
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,170
face down, it has a battery of sensors similar

39
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,530
to an [UNKNOWN] class warship. Light meters, temperature changes, barometers,

40
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,900
gyroscopes, all of which can be used to

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,410
replace text entry or automate processes. Wearables, cars,

42
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,780
and thermostats introduce even more possibilities of sensors.

43
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,850
Connect all of that to the cloud, and the

44
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,460
possibilities are endless. Future of Android isn't a

45
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,420
more powerful phone operating system. It is the

46
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,410
brains behind invisible, ubiquitous, cloud connected computing. So

47
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,620
the skills we learn today to build cool apps

48
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,810
are the same skills we'll use tomorrow

49
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,620
to control everything around us. We've taken

50
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,300
the first step into that future. I can't wait to see what you do next.

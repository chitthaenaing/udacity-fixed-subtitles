1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,260
The most important thing you have to remember is that

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,850
every time you transfer data, no matter how small, the radio

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,130
could stay powered up for nearly half a minute. So every

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,790
decision you make will be based on minimizing the number of

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,540
times that this happens. But of course there's a balance here.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,180
You want to download all the data a user is likely

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,940
to need for the current section in a single burst over

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,520
a single connection at full capacity. But of course, you don't

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,060
just want to pull down everything wasting battery power and bandwidth

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,980
downloading data that's never going to be used. Now I could go

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,750
on for hours on this topic, but Dan's getting impatient. And

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,740
you can learn the details on how to implement each of

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,600
these best practices, including pre-fetching,

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,340
batching and bundling, burying your

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,930
update frequency, and minimizing your payloads by watching the series of

16
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,690
Dev Lite videos or reading the developer guides linked to in

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,670
the instructor notes below. Now before I leave it to Dan

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,910
to show you how to implement a sync adapter for

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,820
Sunshine that takes advantage of a lot of the best practices

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,940
I just described, let's consider what the best practice would be

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,570
if you were building something like a news reader app. How

22
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,030
much data should you download when the app is first started?

23
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,280
Just the front page of headlines, all the stories and images

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,960
linked to from that front page? Every story available, but none

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,830
of the images? Or every story and every image currently available?

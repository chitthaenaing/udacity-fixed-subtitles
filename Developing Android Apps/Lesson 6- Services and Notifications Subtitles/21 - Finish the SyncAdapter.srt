00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,330
All right, you're done. Lets look at the

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,490
solution. We'll begin by adding a log tag

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,160
into our abstract threaded SyncAdapter. Since this stuff

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,880
runs in the background, it's really helpful to have

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,550
some logging. Since we ultimately want to run

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,330
the SyncAdapter in undetected mode. Let's pull the location

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,610
query from our utility class. And then we

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,140
paste in the code from our existing sunshine service.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,050
We'll have to patch a few things up. We'll have to call getContext to

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,590
get the current context, for example. Note that I copied over ad location at

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,770
the same time I copied over the primary function. And then finally, we'll fix

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,210
update weather to use the new helper

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,040
function in our SyncAdapter. Let's run this.

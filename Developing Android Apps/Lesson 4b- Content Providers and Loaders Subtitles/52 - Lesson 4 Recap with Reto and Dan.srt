So, Rato, what have we learned in this lesson?

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,300
>> Well, I learned that I do not want to write

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,060
databases and content providers. What did you learn in this lesson?

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,440
>> Well, J unit tests are awesome, and building

for lesson 5, where we'll shatter our activity into fragments, use

11
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:36,517
our content providers to populate more complex UIs, and build layouts

12

that work as well on tablets as they do on phones.

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,100

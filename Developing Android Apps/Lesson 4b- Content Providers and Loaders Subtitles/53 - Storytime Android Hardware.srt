1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,350
Of all the Android launch devices, the Nexus 1 will

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,560
always hold a special place in my heart. That's not

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,970
to take anything away from my first Android device, the

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,970
HTC G1, that launched Android into the world with its

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,420
distinctive chin and slide-out keyboard, or the HTC Magic. First

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,450
pre release android phone I got to dog food when

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,070
I joined google. And the first, the wave of devices

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,970
we gave every attendee starting at google IO in 2009.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,180
2010 was the year android went from that's

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,650
interesting to global phenomenon. Growing from 100,000 activations a

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,410
day in May, to over 300,000 by December.

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,210
That was seriously helped by the release of the

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,950
Motorola Droid. I can still remember the offices

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,760
here in building 44 echoing with the constant refrain

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,670
of Droid as each device rebooted. The Droid was

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,120
the first of the thinner, higher res, more powerful

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,150
Android devices that have since become standard. And it

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,090
was also the device whose release on Verizon here in

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,420
the U,S. Really kicked off the flood of Android

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,570
activations. But I was a Londoner then, and the Droid

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,910
was a [UNKNOWN] only phone, so it was never

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,050
really a device I truly used. Then, there was the

23
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,320
Nexus One, code-named Passion. The first device I felt was

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,160
pure Android was also the phone we brought with us

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,410
on our 2010 Android Developer Labs World Tour. Me

26
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,200
and my colleagues travel across the world. Seven cities

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,590
in ten days. Introducing over twenty thousand developers to

28
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,250
Android by way of presentations and a free Nexus 1.

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,090
As a result, I made a lot of friends

30
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,200
across Europe and learned exactly how many boxes of phones

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,840
I can carry across snow drifts in Stockholm and

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,340
icy roads in Berlin. Since then, The Nexus S4 and

33
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,890
five have each improved on what it takes, to make

34
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,350
a great android phone. And OEMs across the world, have

35
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,150
created 1000s of different Android devices. Starting with the Motorola

36
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,080
Zoom, which led Android's official expansion into tablets, and leading the

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,960
way for the Nexus 7 and 10. But that was

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,490
just the start, Those changes paved the way for the

39
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,740
Android mobile [UNKNOWN] west, to grow into what could be,

40
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,450
the brains behind anything, from phones and tablets, to TVs, cars

41
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,509
and wearables, like Android wear. It's impossible to know, what comes

42
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:15,510
next. Who knows? Maybe the next Android devices, will be Androids themselves.

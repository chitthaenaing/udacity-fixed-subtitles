1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,540
Alright, you're done. Lets take a look at the solution.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,380
Now we're going to need some text views. First of all lets

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,430
look at our linear layout. It's vertical. We're going to want it

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,930
to be horizontal. The next thing we're going to want are a

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,580
bunch of text views. Lets just drag them in. Now

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,330
remember we had all those ID's that were given to us

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,980
in the last quiz. The first one is the list item

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,730
date text view. And we'll give it some text that makes

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,350
sense when we help to layout the layout. We'll remove

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,890
this before we actually submit it to our project. And

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,960
for fun let's switch to landscape. It'll make things a

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,910
little more legible. Also let's just zoom in a little bit.

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,490
All right. So that's our list item date text view. Now

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,490
right next to that, we want another text view. Since we want the design to be

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:57,550
the same, this one doesn't need to have an ID. If you remember our

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,880
design had the date. Followed by a dash, followed

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,530
by the forecast, followed by a dash, followed by the high,

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,860
followed by a slash, followed by low. So this is just going to be a view that

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:19,900
contains a dash. And we can even hardcode this in. For now, then we're going to

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,400
create another text view next to that. Our

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,560
placeholder text will be a forecast, like clear.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,888
The ID for this will be list item

23
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:33,820
forecast text view. Now we need another text view.

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,740
Once again this one's not going to have an ID, because we don't need it. And

25
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,040
we'll add another dash. Now we're actually getting

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,060
to the high and low forecasts. Let's say

27
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,520
a high of 23. One more plain text view, this one with a slash and, once

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,660
again, with no ID. And for our high

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,960
forecast, it better be list_item_high_text_view. Finally, we'll add one

30
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,060
more plain text view. This one will be for

31
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,360
our low, and of course, that means it's going to

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,639
be list_item_low_text_view. And there we have it. Our multiple text

33
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,180
view layout. Now we might want to make this prettier.

34
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,600
But this is a good start and it just plays

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,730
the four fields that we asked for. They are all

36
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,920
part of a linear layout. Before we actually would submit

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,470
this, lets remove the placeholder tabs for everything except for,

38
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,900
the static fields. We'll also have to remove these empty IDs, its

39
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,440
actually important to understand whats going on in these text views. And there

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,430
we have it, that's what your should look like, At least if you

41
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,150
want to make it look almost identical to the layout we started out

42
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,680
with. Of course you can go wild with these designs, and there's

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,810
a lot you can do with the layout editor and with different kinds

44
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,740
of layouts. We'll be learning more about that in the next lesson. Alright,

45
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,540
we finally get to start hooking this up to our UX. Let's go

46
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,800
back to forecast fragment.

00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,480
It's actually quite straightforward to make your apps content provider

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,880
available to third party apps. The key is to modify

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,640
the export flag in the manifest entry here to true.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,174
As simple as that. Any app that knows the content URI

5
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:16,667
can use the content resolve or access it the same

6
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:19,480
that you do. Now depending on the sensitivity of your

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,660
data, you may want to protect it by requiring specific

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,440
permissions to read or write to the database. So if you

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,080
want to, you can effectively limit access only to other

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,620
apps you have created, or to third party apps, which know

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,270
the permissions and users agree to. Then you just need to

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,050
publish this contract, to interact with the content provider, specifically the

13
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,590
URI and column names. And you've created a simple API

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,120
for all of your data. And as simple as that, you've

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,890
created a new API, just for your data. This is exactly

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,910
the same approach, used by many of the native content providers,

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,460
including the Contacts Database, Media Store, Calendar and Call Log.

1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,670
So once again we're going to replace the one

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,300
remaining part of our test, that still has a

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,460
standard database. Let's actually get rid of our database.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,950
That leaves us with this lonely insert statement. Once

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,090
again, like with everything else, we're going to replace that

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,530
with a content resolver call. And of course we're

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,250
actually not going to be inserting the table. We're going

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,510
inserting the content URI. Getting rid of the nulls.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,870
Of course this doesn't return a location row ID.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,860
That's alright. We can pull it from the URI. Using

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,120
the helper function from content URI's, we can leave

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,160
that insert in there, although it's not necessary. And the

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,630
rest of everything should pretty much be as it

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,510
always is. We're no longer using a database at all

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,140
within test provider, but entirely using the content provider.

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,248
Let's run our tests and see if they still work.

17
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:56,331
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:59,410
And they all pass. Congratulations, we now

19
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,620
have a fully functioning content provider that can

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,560
both insert and query. But, of course,

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,970
there are other things you might want to do

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,810
with the content provider. Now, we're not

23
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,350
actually going to use any of these things

24
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,340
in Sunshine. But it's really important to know.

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,620
So, I suggest you actually implement these functions.

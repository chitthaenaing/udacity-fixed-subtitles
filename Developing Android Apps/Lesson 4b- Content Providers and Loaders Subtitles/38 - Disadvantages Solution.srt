As I said before, early versions of Android

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:07,130
didn't have the loader model. The original deprecated model

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,908
caused frame rate drops whenever many applications had to

4
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:14,750
re-query their databases. Even simple ones. Databases get far

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,329
more complex than what we have here in

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,630
Sunshine. So the first answer is a definite yes.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,980
We noted how things like AsyncTask are bound to

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,450
the UI, so something as little as an orientation

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,780
change could kill the query. So that's another definite

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,224
yes. So the third option is just a non-starter.

1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,918
Let's update the test insert redv test to use

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:05,216
to use the weather provider to get the weather

3
00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:08,650
query. We'll start by changing the name to test,

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,100
insert read provider. So, all we need to do

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,060
is take this dv query, and replace it with

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,590
the equivalent content provider one, which gets the content

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,740
resolver, and then queries the content URI. Now, the

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,670
content provider one doesn't take a few of these parameters.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,660
For example, it doesn't take TABLE_NAME, because that's implied

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,640
by the URI, nor does it support group by.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,046
The rest of it should work pretty well. Now,

12
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:36,211
let's run the test and verify that it passes.

13
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:39,598
[BLANK_AUDIO]

14
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:43,930
And the test still passes. [LAUGH] Again, it's very easy to substitute

15
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,750
out something that calls directly to the database with a content provider.

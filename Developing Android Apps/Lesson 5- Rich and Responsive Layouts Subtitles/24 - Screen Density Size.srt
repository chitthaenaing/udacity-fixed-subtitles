00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,114
Using the screen support page, and whatever technical

2
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:06,078
specification details you can find on the internet, what

3
00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:08,619
are the sizes and densities of these two devices,

4
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:11,190
the Nexus One and the Nexus 5? For these

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,080
purposes, the screen size should be one of

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,580
the available buckets, small, normal, large, or extra large.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,580
And, the pixel density should always refer to one

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,540
of our buckets, LDPI, MDPI, HDPI, XHDPI, or XXHDPI.

On the tablet, there's a bug where if you select an item near

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:05,952
the bottom of the list and then you rotate the device, the selected

3
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:08,888
item is no longer scrolled into view. You have to manually scroll the

4
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:12,270
list. That means we should store the position of the selected item in

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,430
the savedInstanceState Bundle. If the app

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,120
is killed, when it's restored, we should

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,030
read the position back from the Bundle. If the list isn't populated at

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,220
that time, then we should wait for the onLoadFinished callback to use a

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,400
position to scroll to the selected item. Check these boxes when you're done.

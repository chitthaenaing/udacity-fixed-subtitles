00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,360
The solution of the previous quiz said that we

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,030
had to define the wide detail fragment layout in two

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,630
places. The layout-land and the layout-sw600dp folder. To avoid having

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,050
multiple copies of this file, we should use layout aliasing.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,700
We can check the documentation for layout aliases to see

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,670
an example. Say we have a main layout file that's

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,177
for one pane UI. In the layout large and layout-sw600dp

8
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:25,190
folders, we want a multi pane layout. In case you're

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,380
wondering, layout large is for backward compatibility purposes for

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,280
large devices prior to Android 3.2, that's when the SW

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,340
qualifiers were introduced. So back to the point. To

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,290
avoid code duplication, we can define the two pane layout

13
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,161
in the base layout folder. Then, in the values-large

14
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:44,870
and values-sw600dp folders, we can create a reference so that

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,100
the main layout actually maps to the two pane layout.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,950
In the Java code, you can reference it as r.layout.main,

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,640
but it's actually referencing the two pane layout.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,110
This is what the detail fragment should look

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,070
like afterwards. And this is what the phone

20
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,610
landscape view looks like. If you rotate the

21
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,460
device, the phone portrait view should be different.

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,400
In the next coding task, we're going to make

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,800
the today list item look more like the other items in the list for the tablet.

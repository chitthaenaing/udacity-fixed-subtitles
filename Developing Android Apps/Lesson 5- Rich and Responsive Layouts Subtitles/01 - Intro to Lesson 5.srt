Now that we're storing the data we downloaded in

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,300
a sensible fashion, we're ready to build rich UIs

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,210
for each of our activities. That means learning about

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,180
fragments and how we can use them to create

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,370
complex user interfaces that can easily be adapted to

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,850
work seamlessly on a range of different devices and

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,440
screens. But first I'd like to tell you a

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,190
little more about the principles behind great Android design.

1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,310
Open up the Sunshine app. And we'll create a

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,400
new file for our ForecastAdapter, which extends cursor adapter. We

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,690
provided you with a gist of code to get started

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,450
below. The code overrides the newView method, where it inflates

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,690
the list item forecast layout XML. It also provides

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,380
an implementation for bindView, where it reads from the cursor,

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,770
and updates the layout. For example, from the cursor, we

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,470
read the weather forecast description. Then we go and find

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,430
the text view for that within the view hierarchy of the

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,975
list item layout. We look for the text view with the id

11
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:33,690
list_item_forecast_textview. Then we update the

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,990
textview with the right description. We

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,630
also left some to dos in the code. So, go ahead and

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,420
copy over the file and then finish the to dos. In

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,928
the current implementation of the app, all dates are displayed the same.

16
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:47,340
In the wireframes though, you'll notice that we have a more friendly

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,670
date format. In the gist we also included some helper methods and

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,090
strings for date formatting. That's because in our current

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,830
implementation, all the dates are displayed in the same way.

20
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,036
In the wireframes though, we have a more friendly date

21
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:05,620
format. Such as today, tomorrow, Wednesday, Thursday, etc. Here's that

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,680
logic for what the helper method does to get the

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,300
friendly date string. If it's this week it says today,

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,770
or tomorrow, or the day of the week. If it's

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,900
more than a week out then we use the format

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,220
Monday, June 8th and so on. Once you finish the

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,280
to dos and you added the helper methods and strings,

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,110
then go ahead and replace the simple cursor adapter with

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,660
a forecast adapter. After you compile and run the app it'll

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,250
look the same as before with only one list item

31
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,870
view type shown, except now it's using a ForecastAdapter and

32
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,220
now it has better date descriptions. I know that I

33
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,860
promised you that cursor adapters could handle multiple item view types,

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,170
so we'll do that in the next step.

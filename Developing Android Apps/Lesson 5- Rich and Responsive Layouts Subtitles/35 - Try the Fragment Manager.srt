00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,940
We use the FragmentManager to begin a transaction, to look that

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,580
we want to add this transaction to the back stack, and

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,170
then use the replace command, specifying the container ID, whose contents

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,590
we want to replace, and the new fragment we want to

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,700
put in there. And we execute the transaction by calling commit.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,070
Now you can actually chain another of changes within the same

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,160
transaction, so it's also possible to achieve much of the same

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,770
effect by first removing the contents of container A and adding fragment

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,010
B to that container.

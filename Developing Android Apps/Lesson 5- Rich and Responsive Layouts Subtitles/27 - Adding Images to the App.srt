1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,540
We're providing you with an asset drop, view the link below,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,130
so that you can download the images and include them in

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,280
the app. When we open up the assets ZIP file, we

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,190
see that the same icon is provided at different sizes for

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,800
different resolutions. In the drawable MDPI folder, we see the assets

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,710
that will be used on an MDPI device. In the drawable

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,040
HDPI folder, we see the assets that will be used on

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,260
an HDPI device. And the same goes for the other folders.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,000
Under the res directory copy over all the asset

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,580
folders provided in the download. Clicking on an image shows

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,770
a preview of it and the size and pixels

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,580
is also shown. At this time you can also remove

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,500
the old placeholder ic launcher icons. Our new launcher

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,220
icons are located in mipmap folders. These are distinct folders

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,130
from the drawable folders. If you build an APK

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,690
for a target screen resolution like HDPI, the Android asset

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,730
packaging tool, AAPT, can strip out the drawables for other resolutions

18
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,330
that you don't need. But if it's in the mipmap folders,

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,261
then these assets will stay in the APK regardless of the

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,190
target resolution. But when would you need an image at a

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,700
resolution different than the resolution of the device? Well, one example

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,080
is the Android launcher app, which controls the home screen as

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,830
well as the All App store. The launcher app won't use

24
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,741
the icon at the current density of the device, but rather

25
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:22,560
pulls a icon for the next highest resolution up. For an XXHDPI device like the

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,950
Nexus 5, normally the assets will be pulled

27
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,850
from the drawable XXHDPI folder. However, in this

28
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,620
case the launcher icon will pull the XXXHDPI

29
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,320
version of the launcher icon. That will make

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,860
the larger app icons appear sharper on the

31
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,715
all apps screen. In the code replace @drawable/ic_launcher

32
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:47,070
with @mipmap/ic_launcher because of the new location of the icons.

33
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,980
For the rest of the icons modify the forecast list

34
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,160
and the details screen to display the right weather icon

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,110
instead of the placeholder one. See the hints below in

36
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,470
the instructor notes. Using the helper functions we've provided in

37
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,260
the gist below, you can map the weather condition code

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,860
to the icon that you'll need. This is what the

39
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,590
app should look like when you're done with this step.

40
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,400
Note that there are two types of each weather

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,350
icon, a gray icon and a colored art image.

42
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,040
In the main forecast list we'll be using the

43
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,630
gray icon. However, for the today layout, we'll use the

44
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,650
colored icon. When you go inside the detail activity,

45
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,930
you'll also use the colored icon. At this time,

46
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,160
you can also remove any images you hard coded

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,570
into the layout XML, because they'll be populated dynamically now.

1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,540
We definitely need to define fragment detail in the

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,930
base layout folder, then we override it in the

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,300
layout land folder, so that we can achieve this

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,000
layout on phone landscape orientation. Tablet landscape view would

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,200
work fine because of this folder, but then tablet

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,450
portrait would fall back to this layout so we

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,830
should just define it in the layout sw600dp folder

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,960
so that all tablets regardless of orientation use this layout

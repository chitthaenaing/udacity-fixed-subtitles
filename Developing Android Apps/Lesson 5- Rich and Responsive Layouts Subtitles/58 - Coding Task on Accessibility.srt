To evaluate how accessible any app is, you

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,160
can step through the Accessibility Testing Checklist. Some of

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,940
those steps will involve changing the accessibility settings in

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,100
the setting's app. A user will be able to

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,800
choose from these options. We have Talkback, Captions,

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,050
Magnification, increased font size, and more. I want to point

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,140
out one item in particular, Talkback service. Blind and

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,090
low vision users can turn on the Talkback service.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,340
It allows them to navigate around the device with spoken feedback

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,260
as they interact with each UI element on the screen. There

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,310
are slightly different gestures, for example, to select or to focus

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,620
on an item. If it's the first time you turn it

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,490
on, there will be a tutorial that you can step through.

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,780
When the user navigates to these elements, Talkback service will read

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,180
aloud the context description provided. Every UI component that doesn't have

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,960
any visible text has a content

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,710
description. Using Talkback or another accessibility

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,270
tool from the checklist will let the sunshine out. Find and fix at least one

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,660
accessibility issue in the app. Then please share

20
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,250
what you did in the class discussion forum.

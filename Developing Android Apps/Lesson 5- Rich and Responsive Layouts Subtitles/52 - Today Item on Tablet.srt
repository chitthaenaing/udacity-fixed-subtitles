1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,490
In the main activity, we tell the forecast fragment to use a

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,030
special today layout if it's one pane mode. In the fragment, we

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,320
pass on this value to the forecast adapter, if it's not null.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,430
The reason it could be null is because the activity on Create method

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,900
will happen before the fragment on Create View method. And this is

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,580
where the forecast adapter is initialized. So we set the Boolean here,

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,200
as well. The reason we have this code here is because it's

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,180
a public method. So, in the future, it could be called before or

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,230
after this method.

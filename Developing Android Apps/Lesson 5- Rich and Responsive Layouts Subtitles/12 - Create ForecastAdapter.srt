1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,210
Here's the solution. In the utility class, we add the

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,260
helper methods that were provide in the gist. We also

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,970
declared these strings in the strings.xml file. In the Forecast

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,000
Adapter Class, in the bind view method, we finish off the

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,210
remaining to do's. After we read the high temperature value

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,420
from the cursor, we go and try to find the

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,950
text view, represented by the ID, list item high text

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,970
view. Then we use a utility function to format the temperature

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,960
so that it can be displayed in the text view. Then we do the

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,820
same for the low temperature value. In the forecast fragment class, in the on

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,230
create view method, we remove the use of the simple cursor adapter. Instead, we

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,420
use the new forecast adapter and then we set it on the list view.

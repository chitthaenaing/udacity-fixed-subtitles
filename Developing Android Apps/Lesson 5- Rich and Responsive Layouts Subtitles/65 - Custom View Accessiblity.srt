1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,700
So you've got a pretty sweet looking control, but what about

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,160
users who can't see the shiny hotness? Accessibility is a key consideration

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,560
when building apps and particularly when you're creating new views. You

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,850
can start by adding a content description, as you would for every

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,360
other view in your layout, to ensure that they are all

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,820
accessible. But what about views like our wind speed, and direction gauge,

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,250
where the content isn't static? Knowing you're looking at a wind

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,630
gauge isn't very useful if you don't know what the speed and

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,640
direction it's displaying are. Well, there are couple

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,020
of options here. For generic views, which don't control

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,890
their own values, this simplest alternative is to

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,485
set the content description within your app at runtime.

13
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:40,280
An even more robust solution is to send

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,480
an accessibility event from within your view. Whenever the

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,990
visual content has been modified. Then override the dispatch

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,830
populate accessibility event, and then the current control's visual

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,534
value, the accessibility event. Go ahead and add accessibility handlers

18
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:56,730
to your view and then click here when you're done.

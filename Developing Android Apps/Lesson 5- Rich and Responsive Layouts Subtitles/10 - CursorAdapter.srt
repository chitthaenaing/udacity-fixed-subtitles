00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,250
We created the today layout so why doesn't it show

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,910
up? The reason is because we're using a simple CursorAdapter. Remember

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,960
that it creates a list item for every row in the

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,740
cursor but it only supports one item view type. That means

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,970
that all list items must use the same layout. If

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,640
we want today's forecast to look differently we're going to need

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,120
to create a custom CursorAdapter. That way we can have multiple

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,540
item view types. Then we can have different list item layouts

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,130
based on what row of the cursor we're looking at.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,530
Note that the concept of item view types applies to

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,280
adapters in general, not just the CursorAdapter. If you open

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,730
up the documentation for CursorAdapter, you'll see that it's an abstract

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,640
class. It contains two abstract methods that you'll need to

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,052
override. The bindView method as well as the newView method.

15
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:47,260
The newView method knows how to return a new list

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,560
item layout, but doesn't contain data yet. The bindView method knows

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,670
how to take an existing layout and update

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,660
it with the data pointed to by the cursor

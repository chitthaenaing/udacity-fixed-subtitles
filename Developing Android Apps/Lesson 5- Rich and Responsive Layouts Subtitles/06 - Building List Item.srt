00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,800
To build out our UI, let's start with the wire

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,800
frame for the main activity. It displays a list of

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,265
forecasts, where each item contains an icon, a date, weather

4
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:13,640
description; as well as high and low temperatures for that

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,320
day. Since today's weather is probably most relevant to the

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,220
user, we give more prominence to it as a list

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,830
item compared to the other days. We'll start off by

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,730
building the list item layout for future days because it's simpler.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,030
And then afterwards, we'll come back to do the today layout.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,250
In the current implementation, the list item forecast layout XML is

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,450
a horizontal linear layout of four text views. We'll need to

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,460
modify the layout so that it looks like this wire frame.

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,510
We should divide and conquer until we can use the view

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,560
group layouts that we're familiar with. Can you imagine how you'd

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,980
break down this UI into components that you know how to

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,840
build? As a hint, what if I draw these separators here?

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,160
Within those elements, can you find a way to

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,960
break it down even further with view groups you're familiar

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,280
with? You'll need nested view groups, which means view groups

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,940
with children view groups. As a tip, this data will

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,740
be populated dynamically at run time. But you can

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,960
test it by hard coding some text values such as

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,420
Tomorrow for the date or Clear for the weather condition.

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,620
For images, we can specify a placeholder drawable called ic_launcher.

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,850
It's named this way, because it's the launcher icon, which is also

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,820
known as the app icon. And this is already included in our

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,500
app. We'll be getting the rest of our weather icons for our

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,610
app later in this lesson. If you want to see what this layout

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,980
looks like, you can click on the design pane to see a

30
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,970
preview of it. On the right, we see a component tree listing

31
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,830
out the different views. We can also see for a given view

32
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,690
what the properties are, and their values. We can change the orientation

33
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,890
of the device that your previewing, you can also

34
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,900
select different devices such as Nexus 7, or Nexus

35
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,630
10. You can also preview multiple devices at the

36
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,690
same time. As you build out your layout for

37
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,950
this task, don't worry about the font color, or

38
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,500
font size, or any other visual details until later.

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,590
After you compile and run, the app should look

40
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,780
something like this. Check this box when you're done.

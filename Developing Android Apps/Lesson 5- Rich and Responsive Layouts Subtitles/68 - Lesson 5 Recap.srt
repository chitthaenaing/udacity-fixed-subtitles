00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,070
In this lesson, we learned how to create rich, responsive

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,030
user interfaces that work across a variety of different hardware

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,180
types and screen sizes. We also learned more details on

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,020
the Android layout managers and screen widgets and even had to

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,500
create our own views from scratch. Join us for lesson

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,900
six where we take our foreground-only app and discover how to

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,100
make it update and trigger notifications from the background, all

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,650
without draining your battery. But first, join me back at Google

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,110
for another story from the Android history books.

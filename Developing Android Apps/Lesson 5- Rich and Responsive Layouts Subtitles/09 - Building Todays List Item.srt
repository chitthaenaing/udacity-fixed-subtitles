00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,190
Let me the explain the reasoning that I use when I

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,150
look at a new layout. It looks like there's two equally spaced

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,120
columns here. That signals to me we need linear layout weights,

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,460
where each of these have equal weights. So let's create a horizontal

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,712
linear layout. Within this first chart, we have three vertically stacked

6
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:19,830
text views, so we have a vertical linear layout, and the same

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,030
goes for this second chart with has two elements vertically stacked

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,570
on top of each other, which means we use a vertical linear

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,220
layout as well. And here's the code, we created a

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,490
new list item forecasts today XML file under the layout folder.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,340
The code looks very similar to list item forecast. I

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,540
has a horizontal linear layout, as a root element. The first

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,370
channel is a vertical linear layout with the width zero

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,970
and a weight of one. The second child is another vertical

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,300
linear layout with a width of zero and a weight

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,600
of one, that way the horizontal space will be distributed evenly

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,200
among each child. If you go back to the first

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,700
linear layout, notice that we have three text views within

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,630
it. For date, high temperature, and low temperature. We specify

20
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,550
gravity to be center horizontal. So anything within the linear

21
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,220
layout will be centered horizontally. Otherwise, by default, they would

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,590
be left aligned to the linear layout. The same applies

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,270
for the second linear layout. We specify gravity to be

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,720
center horizontal so that the icon and the weather forecast

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,130
text view within it are also centered horizontally.

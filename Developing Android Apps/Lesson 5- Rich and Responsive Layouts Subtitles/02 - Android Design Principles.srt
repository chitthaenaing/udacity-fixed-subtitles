1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,044
Enchant me. Simplify my life. Make me amazing. They're

2
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:09,530
incredibly one-sided wedding vows, and the three key principles

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,380
underlying the Android team's creative vision for the platform

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,840
and the apps that run on it. As engineers,

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,860
it can sometimes be difficult to see past our

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,710
own delight at harnessing the power of an sdk

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,960
to bend a machine to our will, but ultimately,

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,430
our goal must be to create that same empowering experience

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,660
for our users. And we do that by creating apps

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,320
that are as esthetically pleasing as they are functional and

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,240
easy to use. Users judge the quality of your app

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,390
within the first 30 seconds. It may not be fair,

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,480
but a disproportionate amount of that judgement will be based

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,533
not on the functionality, but on the visual aesthetics. Does

15
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:48,330
it look polished? Does it look professional? How easy is

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,800
it to use? More than just looking pretty, the entire user

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,490
experience is critically important. With 30 seconds to

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,505
win users over, it's critical that that onboarding process

19
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:01,520
the time and effort required to go from downloading

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,420
your app to performing it's main function should be

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,800
as short and frictionless as possible. Not only

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,390
that, but a well designed app should evoke a

23
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,530
visceral reaction that speaks to the subconscious. It should

24
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,020
be fun to use. It should surprise in delightful

25
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,590
ways through subtle animations and smooth transitions that contribute

26
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,890
to a feeling of power and effortlessness. It should

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,000
let users touch and interact with objects directly rather

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,490
than having to use buttons and menus. And it should

29
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,660
use rich imagery and pictures in place of lots

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,370
of words and long sentences. It allows users to

31
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,440
customize your app, to make it theirs while providing

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,805
beautiful and sensible defaults. Create something that works like magic,

33
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:44,430
learning your preference in the context provided by

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,260
the device so it never asks users for information

35
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,300
that they've already provided. Provide simple shortcuts to complete

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,460
complex tasks, and remember data settings and customizations making

37
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,750
them available across every device. While it's good practice

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,320
to create a familiar and welcoming experience by creating

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,630
a look and feel that's consistent with the platforms

40
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,810
styles and themes, it's just as important to remember

41
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,710
that this, and all the other principles I've discussed

42
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,270
here, are really just a starting point for your

43
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,190
own creative vision. Deviation from the guidelines is encouraged,

44
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,500
but when you do do so, deviate with purpose.

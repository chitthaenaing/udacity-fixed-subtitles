00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,560
If you open up the documentation, you can see a

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,100
couple of examples of typical screen widths. Then it suggests how

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,260
you can setup your layout folders, so that you can

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,100
have a different mean activity layout for tablets versus for handsets.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,940
And here we define tablets as having a smallest width

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,380
of at least 600 dp. To customize the UI further, we

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,400
can create a layout-sw720dp folder. That way, we can have a

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
different main activity layout for ten inch tablets versus for seven

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,140
inch tablets versus for handsets. So back to

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,130
our quiz. We need to define activity_main.xml file in

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,630
our base layout folder so that we can accomplish

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,840
this layout on the phone. This layout applies to

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,840
both phone, portrait, and landscape, so we don't need

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,755
a special version of the layout in the layout

15
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:46,704
lan folder. We do also need to declare activitymain.xml

16
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:50,680
in the layout-sw600dp folder. That way it will override

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,240
the one pane UI and use a two pane UI in this case. It will be

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,430
picked up on devices that have greater than

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,760
600 gp in both width and height. That

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,440
means seven inch and ten inch devices in

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,140
both portrait and landscape mode. And lastly, we

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,870
don't need layout-sw720dp because we don't have different

23
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,480
layouts for seven inch versus ten inch devices.

1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,740
After copying over the assets, updating the launcher icon

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,270
in the Android manifest, and adding the Helper methods

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,760
to the Utility class, we need to modify the

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,770
DetailFragment and ForecastAdapter classes. In the DetailFragment class, in the

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,940
onLoadFinished method, we read the weather condition code from

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,670
the cursor, then we pass it into the Utility

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,340
Helper method to get the colored icon for setting

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,610
onto the image view. In the detail fragment on load

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,170
finish method, we read the weather condition code from the cursor.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,299
Then we pass this into the Utility helper method, to get

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,430
the Resource ID for the colored icon, in order to set

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,770
it onto the Image View. The forecast adapter change is a

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,660
little trickier because we want to use the colored icon for the

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,420
today layout. And we want to use a grey icon for

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,470
the other days. In order to distinguish between the other two,

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,700
we call get item view type given the current cursor position.

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,470
If the view type is today, then we get the weather condition

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,670
code from the cursor. Then we get the resource ID for the

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,820
colored image from the helper method. And then we set that onto

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,770
the image view. If the view type is for a future day, then

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,150
we read the whether condition code from the cursor. Then we pass

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,150
it into the helper method to get the resource ID the gray

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,180
icon and then we send that on to the image view. If

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,830
you previously hard coded an image into the layout, then you should remove

25
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,860
that value now. Otherwise, on app launch, it will load

26
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,480
up the placeholder image and then flash to the actual

27
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,170
icon. Now that the wire frame implementation for the phone

28
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,170
UI is pretty much complete, let's look at the tablet UI.

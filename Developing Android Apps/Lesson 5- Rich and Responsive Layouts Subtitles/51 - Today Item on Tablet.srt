1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,800
Going back to the wire frames. In the phone layout, we

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,570
wanted the today item to be a little bit bigger. But on

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,410
the tablets, we just want it to look like all the

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,970
other items, because we have an expanded detail pane here. To do

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,320
this in the forecast adapter new view method, we should return

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,060
the layout for a list item forecast not for the today layout.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,760
Then in the bind view method, for the today item, we

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,470
should use the gray icon instead of the colored icon. These decisions

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,140
get controlled by the return value of the getItemViewType method. Therefore,

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,830
we modify the getItemViewType method so that at the zero position,

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,080
if we have to use the special today layout, then we

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,240
return view type today. Otherwise, if we shouldn't use the special

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,620
today layout, then we should just return the view type for

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,800
all future days. This Boolean is controlled by the setter method.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,790
To access this Boolean, we created a public setter method on

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,620
the forecast adapter. But who knows how to set this value properly?

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,380
Well the main activity knows whether it's one pane,

18
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,730
or two pane UI. So, it can decide whether

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,650
we should use the special today layout or not.

20
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,040
We don't have access to the forecast adapter here, but

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,020
we can plumb the value through the forecast fragment.

22
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,319
To get access to the forecast fragment, we can ask

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,350
the fragment manager and pass it the fragment ID.

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,710
Finish changing the code so the app looks like this.

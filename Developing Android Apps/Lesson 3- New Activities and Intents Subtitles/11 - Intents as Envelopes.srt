00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,710
I like to think of intents as envelopes

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,109
each one includes who, or in this case, which component you want it

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,290
delivered to. And there's room for a small amount of data to be delivered,

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,409
packaged as extras.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,000
Primitive tuples that will be available to the application

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,550
component that ultimately receives and opens this intent. So an

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,910
explicit intent, explicitly specifies the name of the recipient, as

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,900
you can see on this envelope. Implicit intents are a

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,800
lot more interesting. Here, we don't specify the name of

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,550
the class. We don't even know what it is. So,

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,500
how do we indicate which activity to launch? Well, you

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,230
know those stories you sometimes hear about letters with fake

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,890
addresses like these that somehow still find their way to the intended

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,410
recipient? Well the intent resolution system on Android, works the same way.

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,940
Finding an activity, capable of performing an action

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,920
you specify on the associated data. So, rather than

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,420
specifying the name of a class, you indicate

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,930
an action you'd like an activity to perform, and

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,000
on what data that action should be performed.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,210
Like this, where we want to address an activity

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,450
that's capable of viewing a website. And because intents

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,200
can cross through application boundaries, the activity that started,

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,900
may not be part of your app. So,

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,270
you can include functionality like this, browsing websites or

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,750
making phone calls or choosing a contact from your address book. All

26
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,150
from within your app, without you having to implement any of it yourself.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,520
You don't even need to know about the app

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,530
that will ultimately service your request. You can find

29
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,850
details of some of the intents supported by native

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,970
apps in Common Intents page of the Android developer site.

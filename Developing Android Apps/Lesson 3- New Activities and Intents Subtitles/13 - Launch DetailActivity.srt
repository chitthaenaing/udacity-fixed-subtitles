1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,360
The solution is to lauch an explicit intent to

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,750
the Detail Activity Class. We'll go to On Create View,

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,610
where our On Item click listener is defined. To

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,460
pass in the Weather Forecast information, we can use an

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,000
intent extra, which is a key value pair in

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,090
the Intent. We use the key name, Intent.extratext, but we

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,800
can use any string for the key. As long as

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,110
we use the same key when reading the information out.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,150
Just as in the toast, we obtain the forecast

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,850
data from the current list item, by calling get

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,600
item on the adapter at the given position. Once

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,320
we've added the intent, we just start the activity.

1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,118
In order to launch the SettingsActivity, we modify

2
00:00:03,118 --> 00:00:07,070
Mainactivity.java, in the On options item selected method.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,360
When the Settings Menu Item is selected, we

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,590
create a new, explicit intent, to the SettingsActivity Class.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,700
We call Start activity, to launch this intent.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,290
We don't call StartActivity for result because we're

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,640
not expecting a result from the SettingsActivity. Similarly

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,400
in the detail activity class, when the settings menu

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,550
is selected, we launch a new intent to SettingsActivity.

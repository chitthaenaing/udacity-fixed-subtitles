00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,440
Add a menu option to view the user's preferred location on a map. It

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,410
will be handled by any maps app that's available on your device. If there

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,240
is no map app on your device, handle this case gracefully to avoid a

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,620
crash. You might want to recall that

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,460
we use SharedPreferences to store the preferred location.

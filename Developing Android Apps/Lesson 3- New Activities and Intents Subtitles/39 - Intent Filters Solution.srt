00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,220
You could register a listener for the action power connected

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,630
event and you should do that within your manifest. That

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,420
way, it can be called to start your app once

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,190
the device is getting charged, even if it's been terminated since

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,200
the last time you were using it. You can use

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,830
a similar approach to delay trying to send data until the

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,270
device has internet connectivity. Would it change behavior of the

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,950
user experience when you're connected to a car or desk dock?

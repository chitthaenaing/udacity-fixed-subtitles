On app launch, I know that you're probably tired of seeing the dummy data and

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,721
needing to hit the refresh button for real data every single time.

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:10,630
I'm going to show you how to display the data using the current settings each

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,250
time the activity is loaded. In forecast fragment,

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,530
we just refactored the code so that when the refresh button is selected,

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,250
we call this helper method, updateWeather. Now that it's in a helper method,

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,160
we can also call it from the onStart method. We over write onStart so

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,970
that the refresh happens whenever the fragment starts.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,950
This will cause the weather data to appear. We'll learn all about on start, and

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,360
the rest of the android life cycle in the next lesson. At this point,

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,190
we can also remove all the fake data that we had in the onCreateView method.

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,250
Then we pass in an empty array list to the ArrayAdapter. Now we can test this.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,510
We need to make sure that this is the first app launch and

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,820
that it wasn't already running,. So if it's already running, kill it.

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,240
And then tap to open the app,

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,820
and then you should see the actual weather data immediately. Under settings we

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,310
can change the location to be the pairs postal code. We hit OK, and

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,950
then return to the main list, and then we see that the weather data has updated.

00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,689
Done already. Let's go to the solution. In the menu layout file for the main

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,540
activity, called main.xml, we add another menu item

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,740
that will always be in the overflow menu.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:20,280
We also define the string in the strings.xml file. The menu will be inflated in

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,770
the main activity class, so we can handle

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,550
the map menu item being inflated. By calling

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,230
helper method called open preferred location in

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,650
map. The helper method reads the users

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,650
preferred location from shared preferences. Then we

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,240
create a view intent, indicating it's location

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,460
in the data URI. The format of the data URI was from the documentation

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,150
page on common intents. Where you can append a postal code as a query parameter.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,479
Finally, we start an activity with [SOUND] this intent. Note

14
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,560
that we only start the activity, if the activity resolves successfully.

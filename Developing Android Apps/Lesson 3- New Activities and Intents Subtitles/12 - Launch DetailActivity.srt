Thanks, Rado. Now that you understand what

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,960
intents are in glorious metaphor, let's use them

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,370
to do something useful. We'll replace the toast,

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,660
with an intent to launch the detail activity.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,830
You'll need to pass in weather forecast data for the detail activity to

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,230
display. For more information, see the intent

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,760
extra constants defined in the intent class.

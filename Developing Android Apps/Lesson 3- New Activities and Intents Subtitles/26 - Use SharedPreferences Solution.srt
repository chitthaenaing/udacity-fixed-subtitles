Within the forecast fragment class, when the refresh menu item is selected,

00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,312
we read from SharedPreferences. Since they are key-value pairs, we get their

3
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:14,000
value stored for the location key. If there's no value stored then we fall back

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,930
to the default location. Then we pass the location into the fetch weather task.

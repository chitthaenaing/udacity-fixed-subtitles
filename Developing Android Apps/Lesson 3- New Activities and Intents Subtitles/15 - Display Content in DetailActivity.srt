1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,660
In the fragment detailed layout, a text view

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,160
is already defined. We have to assign it an

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,200
ID so that within the detail fragment of detail

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,120
activity we can use find view by ID to

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,180
find the text view. To determine the forecast

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,150
info that the text view should display. We can

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,770
access the intent that the detail activity was launched

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,255
by. We're going to use this inside of onCreateView.

9
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:30,565
[SOUND] Since we added an intent extra with the forecast

10
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:35,461
data there. We can read that intent extra back to display in the text

11
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:39,289
view, as you can see we pulled the forecast string from the

12
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,840
intent find our rootView and then set the text to that forecast string

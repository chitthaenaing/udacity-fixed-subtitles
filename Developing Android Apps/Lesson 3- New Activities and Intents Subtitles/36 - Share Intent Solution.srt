00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,492
Here's our coding solution for the share action

2
00:00:02,492 --> 00:00:07,140
provider. Lets start by adding a string. The

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,590
string will be used for the label for our action. Now we're going to add a new

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,250
menu resource. This resource will be for the

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,360
detail fragment. We'll start by adding the name

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,780
space used by the Android support library for

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,390
it's widget XML. Finally, we add the actual item.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,340
This menu item contains the string that we

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,200
just added from the strings file. It's always

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,130
shown as an action. So it appears on

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,499
the action bar. And it's actionProviderClass, is the ShareActionProvider

12
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:40,710
from the Android support library. The Android support

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,000
library allows the ShareActionProvider to be used on earlier

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,530
versions of Android then 4.0. When it was

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,550
officially added to the framework. Next, let's go to

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,704
the DetailAactivity. We're going to be looking at the

17
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:57,750
DetailFragment within the DetailActivity. So the first thing

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,860
we can do in our fragment is to add a few useful things. Let's add a log

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,590
tag, a string for the share hashtag, hashtag

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,840
sunshineApp, and we're going to take the forecast

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,430
string and make it a member variable. Next

22
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,070
in onCreate view, let's actually populate our member variable.

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,330
And then finally, use it to set the text.

24
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,610
Lets create a share intent. This intent uses ACTION_SEND.

25
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,120
This flag activity cleared when task reset is somewhat

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,470
important. It prevents the activity we're sharing to from

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,970
being place onto the activity stack. What will happen,

28
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,740
if we don't have this flag, is when you

29
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,230
click on the icon to return to the application

30
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,550
later, you may actually end up in another application.

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,060
The one that's actually handling the share intent. When

32
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,500
FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_WHEN_TASK_RESET is used, it'll actually return you to your

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,410
application instead. We've set the type, test/plain, to let

34
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,380
Android know we're going to be sharing plain text. And

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,460
then we share our forecast string plus our hashtag.

36
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,820
Only one more thing left to do. We have

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,450
to add the menu to the fragment. To do

38
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,690
this, we have to set a flag that this fragment

39
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,940
has an options menu at all. Otherwise, it

40
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,260
won't actually call the onCreate options menu member

41
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,350
function. Finally, here's our on creat options member

42
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,555
function. As you can see, we're inflating the

43
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,846
detailfragment menu that we created earlier. Finding the

44
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:25,644
share item, getting the ShareActionProvider, and attaching our

45
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:29,360
intent to this ShareActionProvider. You'll want to update

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,700
this whenever the data you want to share changes.

47
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,480
And that's it. You've now added a ShareActionProvider into Sunshine.

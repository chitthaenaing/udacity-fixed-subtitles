1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,920
I'll show you how we can add breakpoints in our code. Go ahead and

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,960
click on the screen bug icon, to attach the debugger.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,708
We'll go to the Settings menu. In the SettingsActivity I'm going to add two

4
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:20,492
breakpoints, in the onPreferenceChange method. I'm going to add a breakpoint at

5
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:24,790
line 59 in the case of a ListPreference when it's about to set the summary. I'm

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,170
also going to add a breakpoint at line 63, when it's not a ListPreference and it

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,120
sets the summary. Let's go into the app to try it out. Tap on the Location and

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,530
change the postal code. If you hit OK, then it triggers the breakpoint to

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,140
stop at right here. These are the values of the variables at this time.

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,110
And we see the new postal code here. You can step over or into the method for

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,960
more details. Or you can hit Play to continue. Or Stop to stop the debugger.

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,410
Let's hit Play to continue. And then we see that the [UNKNOWN] has been

13
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,800
updated to the, the preference summary, is the new postal code. Let's try it for

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,830
Temperature Units. They tap here, and then select Imperial.

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,190
It triggers this breakpoint in the ListPreference case. We hit Play to continue,

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,760
and then we see that, Imperial is now the preference summary.

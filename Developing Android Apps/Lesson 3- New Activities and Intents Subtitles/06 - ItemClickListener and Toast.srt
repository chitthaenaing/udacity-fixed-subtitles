00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,220
When the list item is clicked, use Android's Toast mechanism to display

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,777
the weather forecast string. A Toast is a pop-up that displays a message for

3
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:13,230
a few seconds before fading out. It's particularly useful for debugging, where

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,430
it can be used as a way to indicate status visually without altering the app UI.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,600
We're going to put our list view, set item click listener into forecast fragment

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,425
inside of the on create view method. We'll just start typing

7
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:35,120
listView.setOnItemClickListener and

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,750
let the auto complete fill in the rest. Inside of this function,

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,900
we're going to add click listener, which we can instantiate in place. So

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,100
here's where we can call the code in Android to display the Toast. So, now that

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,980
you know where to place the Toast code, take a look at the Toast documentation.

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,770
Add a Toast when the list item is clicked that contains the weather information.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,350
Hint. You can get the forecast by getting an item from the forecast adapter,

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,930
at the position given by the on item click listener.

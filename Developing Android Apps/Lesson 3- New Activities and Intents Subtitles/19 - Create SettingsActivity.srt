00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,990
We'll take advantage of what the framework offers in order to build our

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,890
SettingsActivity. Since we're supporting Gingerbread devices,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,628
we'll use a preference activity class. If you're targeting Honeycomber later,

4
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:13,220
you'll want to use the PreferenceFragment class.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,480
Create a new SettingsActivity class from the gist provided below.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,000
Update the AndroidManifest to declare this new activity. You can see the way

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,390
detail activity is declared as an example. If you see that APIs are deprecated,

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,600
that's okay. That's a side effect of using PreferenceActivity, in order

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,980
to target Gingerbread devices. When you create your app for your final project,

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,460
you can use the wizard in Android Studio to create a new SettingsActivity.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,830
The code the wizard provides will make your app backward compatible,

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:49,040
by using a combination of preference activity and PreferenceFragment.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,280
Our gist is meant to be a simplified version of that for learning purposes. So

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,970
later, you'd be able to understand better what the wizard is doing.

15
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,350
Check these items off when you're done.

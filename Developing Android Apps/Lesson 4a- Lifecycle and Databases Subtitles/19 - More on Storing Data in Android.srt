00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,380
Using SQLI makes it easy to delete, update, and insert rows using highly

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,600
expressive queries. One can even add new columns as you revision your database.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,020
It's not a surprise that just about popular app makes some use of SQLI to

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,980
Android. It's a very popular and important component of the Android solution.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,620
Android also provides a huge set of helper functions to make working with

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,530
databases easy, including functions to automate query building.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,180
Display ListView is populated by queries and even compile statements. For

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,780
more information about databases in Android, see the instructor nodes. One thing

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,100
that I wanted to mention is that we're teaching you the fundamentals of how to

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,740
build database in a content provider on Android. The idea is that once you

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,530
are done with this class, you'll have a good understanding of how it all works,

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,720
even if you end up using a library to help build your database and

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,100
content provider in your future applications. That's it for

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,840
a brief intro into storage on Android. If you want to learn more,

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,500
go to developer.android.com and search on Data Storage.

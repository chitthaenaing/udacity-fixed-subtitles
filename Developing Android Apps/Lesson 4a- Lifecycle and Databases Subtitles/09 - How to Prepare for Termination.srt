00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,400
As you are moving around between apps, you probably notice that from a user

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,670
perspective, Android doesn't announce changes in app state. It doesn't announce,

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,890
that it's low in memory or ask users to close apps, to free up resources. In

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,010
fact, it does everything it can, to make the resource limitation to the device,

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,800
invisible to the user. That means keeping the foreground app running smoothly,

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,100
and switching between apps seamless, and that means killing apps in

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,420
the background. And it does that if it

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,690
needs their resources to make sure that the foreground apps can continue to run.

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,080
So we know that as soon as your app isn't visible, its lifetime is as

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,810
perilous as that of a Stark at the Red Wedding. Likely to die without notice,

11
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,670
but ready to return from the dead. That tells us some very important things

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,140
about how our app should behave to be good citizens and provide a great user

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,600
experience. From a system perspective, on pause and on stop are signals that our

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,990
app may be killed eminently. So we need to clean up any resources that

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,990
need an orderly tear down such as closing any open connections or sockets.

00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,560
We need to create a contract for our other table that contains location entries.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,790
Location entries must contain a city name. This innerclass will be

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,450
created in much the same way as weatherentry. It will implement base columns.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,720
Contain the table name and contain the names of each column. Note: the idea of

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,660
each row in the location entry class, will be stored in WeatherEntry.

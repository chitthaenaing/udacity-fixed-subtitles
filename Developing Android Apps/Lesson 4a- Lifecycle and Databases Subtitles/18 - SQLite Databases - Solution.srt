1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,490
It will actually return a single row containing the max high temperature.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,900
We're using a descending order for this column, which will place the largest

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,730
value at the beginning of the query. The limit statement tells SQLite to

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,920
only return a single row. We return a row that has the largest value.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,610
If we wanted to get the most recent high, we could order by max desc, date desc.

00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,520
All right, you're done. I hope you don't mind that I gave you

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,010
the larger table this time. But it depends on the first one, so it would've been

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,510
hard to give you in any other order. I gave you the content value structure, so

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,820
it's pretty easy to just insert the data. Then, we query the data back out.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,811
[SOUND] If move to first fails, the cursor is empty, and

6
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:24,258
the query failed. [LAUGH] Lots of cut and paste here. It is nice to fetch the dv

7
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:28,606
values using the helper for the data type, although its not strictly necessary,

8
00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:32,759
since we know our test data is actually going to match our constrains. And

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,430
there is one more failure case we need to add here, if our query doesn't return

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,920
any rows. And that's it. All that just to get a database and

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,790
a way to test it. Now let's run the test again. Well, at

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,140
least we know all the basic stuff works, and just remember, without these tests,

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,440
you wouldn't have been able to run this code for a very, very long time.

1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,170
Now, we should be able to figure out the most

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,530
appropriate URL that our app should use. Based on the

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,360
UX wireframes that we saw earlier, you noticed that we'll

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,080
want one week's worth of data. For this quiz and for

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,130
the example code that I'll be showing you later, we're

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,280
going to be using the postal code for Mountain View which is

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,260
94043. By all means, you should use your own location

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,760
either specifying the postal code, city name or the latitude, longitude

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,190
coordinates. Next we want their format from the server to be in JSON format,

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,590
and we want the units to be reported in metric. But our UI will

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,240
be able to display Celsius or Fahrenheit

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,170
based on user preferences, and we'll just

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,038
do the conversion ourself. Enter the URL

14
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:46,590
that fulfills these requirements in the box below,
